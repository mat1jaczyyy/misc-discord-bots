# Miscellaneous Discord bots

This repository hosts the source code for the deprecated and inactive miscellanous Discord bots I've written in the past.

`mat2jaczyyy.py` was used as a role manager and bridge to Cleverbot. Also subscribe to trilogy:tm:.

`remindme.py` is a simple response bot that accepts a timeframe and reminds the user of a select message after the timeframe has passed.

If anyone wants to revive the projects, work on them and host them, be my guest.
